Calculates yards of material needed to cover square feet to a given depth in inches. User enters dimensions, calculator returns results in cubic yards.

== Description ==

A simple form to calculate how many yards of material (such as bark mulch, soil, concrete, gravel, etc) are needed to cover square feet to a given depth in inches.

User enters length and width in feet and depth in inches; the calculator returns yards of material needed, rounded up to the nearest whole number.

The calculator has no dependencies and no options in the admin panel, and is style agnostic.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Use the shortcode [yardagecalc] to add the calculator wherever you want it. Alternatively, you could also include the form in a page template with `<?php echo do_shortcode("[yardagecalc]"); ?>`.
